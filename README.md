# Project
A javascript to-do list learning project that I am building where I will progressively adds functionality according to a mentors changing feature list.

## Phase I
Build a simple to-do list with, at a minimum, the below functionality:
- add tasks
- delete tasks
- edit tasks
- display the list

## Phase II
- add the ability to make the list persistent (it survives closing and reopening the browser)
